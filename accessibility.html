        <h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
        <p>This website provides a high level of accessibility and is suitable for most people to use, while also facilitating screen-readers and other tools. No pages or content are unavailable for people with limited accessibility. There is a contact form for reporting issues with accessibility or suggesting changes.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility in this Website</h2>
  
        <p>I used the accessibility principles POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) to make sure my website had a good standard of accessibility. POUR was created by the Web Accessibility Initiative, a reputable source on website accessibility. </p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, 2022, Accessibility Principles, Accessed 11/2022, {https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/} </a>
        <p>Perceivable covers the content which is sensed. I made the text and background high contrast to aid legibility. Non-textual content like images and forms have captions/labels to show what they are for, and images also have alternative text to convey its meaning when using screen-readers or other accessibility tools.</p>
        <p>Operable covers the functionality of the website. The website can be navigated with keyboard and all user functionality on the website can be accessed and operated by keyboard. This means users that cannot use a mouse can still access every part of the website.</p>
        <p>Understandable makes sure the website works in a logical way. To ensure this, the website has a consistent navigation system for every page and instructions for every interactive part of the website. </p> 
        <p>Robust simply refers to the website working in different environments and with many accessibility tools. To check this, the website was tested on different browsers and on different viewports.</p>
